	\begin{abstract}
		This work aims to produce, given an Italian text, a syllabified version (with syllables separed by $\#$) of it, a dictionary of encountered syllables mapping each of them to their count, and order statistics on them (most frequent, least frequent and centiles).
		Peculiar aspects of the Italian language, in general, and of poetic style, in particular, are exploited to solve, up to a very satisfactory accuracy, the diphthong/hiatus ambiguity (which plays an important role in the syllabification process), and the algorithm is developed in order to be robust with respect to punctuation marks and capitalization.
		
		Albeit, clearly language dependent, the software architecture aims to be easily adaptable to one's needs, while remaining scalable. For this purpose, the syllable-splitting algorithm is implemented in a functional-programming style and different software architectures are explored.
		Furthermore some unit tests are implemented and the entire tool's scalability is benchmarked against long texts based on Dante's \emph{Commedia}.
